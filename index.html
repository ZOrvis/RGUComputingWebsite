        <h2>Introduction to the School of Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Now, this is a story all about how
            My life got flipped-turned upside down
            And I'd like to take a minute
            Just sit right there
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
            In west Philadelphia born and raised
            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
            Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
            And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
            When a couple of guys who were up to no good
            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
            She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
            I begged and pleaded with her day after day
            But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
            She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
            I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
            First class, yo this is bad
            Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
            Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
            Hmm this might be alright.
            But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
            Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
            I don't think so
            I'll see when I get there
            I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
            Well, the plane landed and when I came out
            There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
            I ain't trying to get arrested yet
            I just got here
            I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
            I whistled for a cab and when it came near
            The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
            If anything I could say that this cab was rare
            But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
            I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
            And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
            I looked at my kingdom
            I was finally there
            To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
            
            What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, 
            you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in
            the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on 
            Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in 
            gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. 
            You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck 
            out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this
            Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that
            shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am 
            contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being
            traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm 
            that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking 
            dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven 
            hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively
            trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the 
            United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your
            miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you 
            could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was 
            about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.
            But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn 
            idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
