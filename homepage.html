                Ball so hard, since we here
                It’s only right that we be fair
                Psycho, I’m liable to go Michael
                Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
                Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don’t tick tock
                Audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
                Ball so hard, I’m shocked too,
                I’m supposed to be locked up too
                you escaped what I’ve escaped
                You’d be in Paris getting fucked up too
                Ball so hard, let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
                Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
                So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,
                Chi towns D. Rose, I’m movin’ the Nets to BK

                I don't even know what that means.
                (No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
                No, it's not, it's gross
                (It gets the people going!)
